# The-Caster-Chronicles

## Introduction
Welcome to The Caster Chronicles! This repository contains everything you'll need to play The Caster Chronicles on the program [Cockatrice](https://cockatrice.github.io/). Cockatrice is a program developed in C++ and QT5 for playing Magic: the Gathering by 
a set of awesome developers. The documentation for their program is very robust, and you can learn everything you need to know about it by following the provided link. Thus, I'll only be giving the basic instructions and some tips and tricks in this guide.

## Installation instructions
This installation guide assumes basic computer literacy and a system without Cockatrice installed.

1. Install Cockatrice for your given system, following all on-screen prompts. 
2. Download this repository and unzip it to a location of your choice.
3. In your file explorer, navigate to AppData/Local/Cockatrice/Cockatrice. *(Hint: If you don't know how to find your AppData folder, go to the address bar of your file explorer and type %AppData%. This takes you to AppData/Roaming. Go up one level and you'll find yourself in AppData, and you should be able to navigate from there.)*
4. Drag the `customsets` and `themes` folders of the unzipped repository into the Cockatrice folder. If you already have these folders created, merge the contents.
5. Open Cockatrice and follow any prompts that it gives to enable sets. If you don't see any Casters cards in the card list, restart Cockatrice.
6. In the settings menu (Cockatrice -> Settings), in the "Appearance" tab, select Casters in the dropdown.

You're done! Restart Cockatrice if needed, then start building and playing!

## Using Cockatrice for The Caster Chronicles
Here are some gameplay tips and tricks to help your game go smoothly and effectively.

1. To place a card facedown on the field, hold `Shift` as you drag the card from whatever zone it's in to the field. For example, as you place orbs at the beginning of the game, hold `Shift` and drag seven cards to the bottom row of your field.
2. Double-clicking a card will usually get it to where you want it to go. For example, double-clicking a Caster will automatically put it in your "Caster Zone" *(the bottom row of the play area)*, and double-clicking a Servant card will put it in the stack area *(chase area)*. Double-clicking that Servant again in the stack will put it into your field.
3. To corrupt an orb, **always use the "peek" command on that card before moving it to your hand!** If you don't,
