# The-Caster-Chronicles

## Introduction
Welcome to The Caster Chronicles! This repository contains everything you'll need to play The Caster Chronicles on the program [Cockatrice](https://cockatrice.github.io/). Cockatrice is a program developed in C++ and QT5 for playing Magic: the Gathering by 
a set of awesome developers. The documentation for their program is very robust, and you can learn everything you need to know about it by following the provided link. Thus, I'll only be giving the basic instructions and some tips and tricks in this guide.

## Installation instructions
This installation guide assumes basic computer literacy and a system without Cockatrice installed.

1. Install Cockatrice for your given system, following all on-screen prompts. 
2. Download this repository and unzip it to a location of your choice.
3. In your file explorer, navigate to AppData/Local/Cockatrice/Cockatrice. *(Hint: If you don't know how to find your AppData folder, go to the address bar of your file explorer and type %AppData%. This takes you to AppData/Roaming. Go up one level and you'll find yourself in AppData, and you should be able to navigate from there.)*
4. Drag the `customsets` and `themes` folders of the unzipped repository into the Cockatrice folder. If you already have these folders created, merge the contents.
5. Open Cockatrice and follow any prompts that it gives to enable sets. If you don't see any Casters cards in the card list, restart Cockatrice.
